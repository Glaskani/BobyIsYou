# Boby Is You

Boby Is You is a small game copy of [Baba Is You](https://store.steampowered.com/app/736260/Baba_Is_You/). Baba Is You is an award-winning puzzle game where you can change the rules by which you play. In every level, the rules themselves are present as blocks you can interact with; by manipulating them, you can change how the level works and cause surprising, unexpected interactions! With some simple block-pushing you can turn yourself into a rock, turn patches of grass into dangerously hot obstacles, and even change the goal you need to reach to something entirely different.

This game is develop in java and uses JavaFX. If you want more information there is a report: "BobyIsYou.pdf" and an UML diagram: "BobyIsYou.mdj".
